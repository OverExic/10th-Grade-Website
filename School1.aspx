            1.Get a planner or calendar. Whether it's a day planner you carry in your backpack,
            a calendar on your wall at home, or a to-do list you make at the end of every day,
            it can help you keep track of when assignments are due and stay organized. At the
            beginning of the term, when you get a planner, write down every test, quiz, and
            assignment due date. Do this for each class. Every day when you get home from school,
            check your calendar and see what needs to be done before tomorrow, as well as what's
            on the horizon for the next few days. Check off what you have already done.

            2. Clean out your locker/backpack/school case. It is always important to have a
            tidy workspace and tools. You will find things easier and know when something is
            lost. Take the time and spill everything out and put it back in place.

            3. Make a schedule. Find out when you have upcoming tests. Mark the dates. Write
            out any notes and reminders for the day. Plan out your study time and social time.
            Keep track of your life so you don't fall behind school tasks and cancel social
            events and hangouts.

            4. Do your Homework. Homework helps you practice and learn the material better.
            People who tend to do homework do better in tests. Also, teachers like students
            who show will to learn. They will acknowledge your efforts and raise your overall
            grade.

            5. Ask for help. When you feel like you do not know something, do not wave it off.
            Go seek help! Ask your teacher to explain it. Ask questions during lessons. Ask
            your friends to help you understand. Ask your parents to help you. Get a tutor and
            sit on the material until you understand it.

            6. Try to stay healthy. Shower daily. Brush your teeth. Eat correct foods before
            big exams. Sleep atleast 8 hours a night. Health plays an important role in school
            life.

            7. Always study before tests. Do not rely on your memory from the lessons or homework.
            Sit and study until you feel confident. Take 10 minute breaks between 45 minute
            study session.
