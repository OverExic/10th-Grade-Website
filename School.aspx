            <b>How to Concentrate in a Hot Classroom</b>
            <br />
            Some classes can be difficult to concentrate in. Add in heat and humidity, and you
            can find yourself daydreaming of diving in a pool or laying on a glacier, instead
            of focusing on what's going on in the classroom. No longer shall you miss vital
            notes because you were wishing for a cool air front to move through the city.
