            <b>How to Concentrate in a Hot Classroom</b>
            <br />
            Some classes can be difficult to concentrate in. Add in heat and humidity, and you
            can find yourself daydreaming of diving in a pool or laying on a glacier, instead
            of focusing on what's going on in the classroom. No longer shall you miss vital
            notes because you were wishing for a cool air front to move through the city.

            1. Drink plenty of water. If you know ahead of time that it will be very warm outside,
            bring an ice-cold bottle of water. Otherwise, ask the instructor if you can go to
            the water fountain. Dizziness and nausea as a result of being dehydrated will distract
            you from what's being taught.

            2. Chew minty or wintergreen gum. Not only will the cooling sensation in your mouth
            provide temporary relief, but the act of chewing can keep you awake instead of dozing
            off. Try drinking a sip of water while chewing the gum, it wil increase your awakeness.

            3. Tie any long hair off your face and neck. If you don't have a hair band, use
            a rubber band. While it's not ideal, it can provide relief for the time being. Shorter
            hair can be easily clipped away from the face. Roll up long sleeves and cuff pant
            legs, if this is allowed in your school's dress code. Kick off your shoes for a
            few minutes to get fresh, cooler air to your feet. Be sure they are available to
            be put right back on.

            4. Apply a cool paper towel over your face, neck, and other warm regions. Ask the
            instructor for a lavatory pass, and dampen a paper towel with cold water. Apply
            it to whatever body part you desire.

            5. Make a small fan with a piece of notebook paper. Be sure it will not be disruptive
            to other classmates. Ask the teacher for permission to be sure and in-order to avoid
            possible anger from the teacher.

            6. Stick it through. The class will be over soon, and you can be free in cooler
            classrooms. Try to concentrate on what the teacher is saying, and actively participate
            in the lesson.
