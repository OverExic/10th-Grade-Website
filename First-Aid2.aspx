            <b>How to treat a broken finger</b><br />
            Poisoning by way of household substances, toxic berries, dangerous fumes, and other
            sources leads to thousands of hospitalizations every year. Knowing how to handle
            the situation quickly and effectively can mean the difference between survival or
            death. Read this article so you'll know just what to do in case you have to help
            someone who has been poisoned.

            1. Check your finger for any bruising or swelling. Bruising and swelling will likely
            occur because you have broken tiny blood vessels in your finger. If you have fractured
            the fingertip, there will likely be purple blood visible underneath your nail and
            bruising on the pad of your finger. You may also feel a sharp pain when you touch
            the finger. This is a symptom of a broken finger. Some people can still move their
            finger though it might be broken and may experience numbness or a dull pain. But
            these could still be signs of a fractured or broken finger and require immediate
            medical attention.Check for sensation loss or loss of capillary refill. Capillary
            refill is the return of blood to the finger after pressure has been applied.

            2. Examine your finger for any exposed cuts or bones. You may see large open wounds
            or pieces of bone that have broken your skin and are sticking out of your skin.
            These are signs of a severe fracture, known as a compound fracture. If you have
            these symptoms, you should seek immediate medical attention. As well, if there a
            lot of blood coming from an open wound on your finger, you should see a doctor

            3. Check if your finger looks deformed. If part of your finger is pointing in a
            different direction, the bone is probably broken or dislocated. A dislocated finger
            occurs when the bone has moved out of position and usually looks deformed at a joint,
            such as your knuckle. You should see a doctor if you have a dislocated finger. There
            are three bones in each of your fingers and they are all arranged in the same manner.
            The first bone is the proximal phalanx, the second bone is the middle phalanx, and
            the bone farthest from your hand is the distal phalanx. Because your thumb is the
            shortest finger, it does not have a middle phalanx. Your knuckles are joints formed
            by the bones of your fingers. Often, you break your finger at the knuckles, or the
            joints. Breaks at the base of your finger (the distal phalanx) are usually easier
            to treat than fractures at your joints or knuckles

            4. Apply ice to the finger. Wrap the ice in a towel and apply it to the finger on
            your way to the emergency room. This will reduce swelling and bruising. Never apply
            ice directly to your skin.[10] Keep your finger elevated as you ice it, above your
            heart. This will allow gravity to help reduce the swelling and bleeding.

            5. Let your doctor do an X-ray of your finger. This will allow the doctor to confirm
            whether there is a fracture of the bone in your finger. There are two types of fractures:
            simple and complex. The type of fracture you have will determine your treatment.
            Simple fractures are breaks or cracks in the bone that do not break through the
            skin. Complex fractures are breaks in which the bone sticks though the skin.

            6.See a physiotherapist if your injury is severe. The physiotherapist can give you
            advice on how to regain normal movement in your finger. She may also give you gentle
            hand exercises you can do to keep your finger moving and to ensure it regains its
            mobility
