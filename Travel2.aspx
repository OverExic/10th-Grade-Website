            <b>How to Be Entertained on a Long Car Ride</b>
            <br />
            During long car rides you have no choice but to stay where you are. When it's hot
            your pants get all sticky and well, it sucks. When it's snowing snow obviously will
            be everywhere and will make your ride longer, so you wanna be entertained? here:

            1.Pack a type of food you really like, and a lot of it! You might get tired of it
            so pack some crackers or grapes. Make sure you pack at least 6 or more big bottles
            of water! Depending on how many people are in the car.

            2. Charge all your electronics to the max and USE them! Don't forget chargers for
            the devices and headphones! Remember if you're listening to music to turn off your phone screen 
            in-order to save battery.

            3. If you have a pet with you in the car with lots of fur dont sit too close, it
            will just make you hotter, but of course you can cuddle and pet them. If its cold
            go ahead and SNUGGLE!! (If your dog sheds a lot bring a lint roller)

            4. Download games on your phone. Download games which require time and are fun. 
            Make sure you downalod a lot and if you do not like the game you can always uninstall on the way.

            5. Make a playlist with all your favorite songs. Make sure you bring your earphones/headphones and
            listen to your favorite tracks while you look out the window of the car.
